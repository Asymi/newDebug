# LAP 2 Debugging Assignment

Welcome to your second debugging assignment!
As before, this repo is riddled with bugs. This one is going to be a bit more of a 'treasure hunt' with less hints on what is required. Run the code and follow the errors to find all the bugs. Use the demo gif as a reference to the intended behaviour.

**Please make sure that you read the instructions before starting.**


## Code of Conduct
- Do not ask your classmates (verbally or through any other communication method) for help.
- Do not copy/paste any code from someone else or from any online resource.


## Tasks
You are going to debug an app called *Sunrise, Sunset*. Users can search for a location name and they receive the time of today's sunrise and sunset in that location. When you are finished with the app, it should look like this:

### React
- Ensure the React app can mount and load successfully
- Ensure any data is being passed around appropriately
- Ensure any inputs follow a controlled pattern
- See the screen cap above for intended behaviour

### Redux
- Ensure data is accessible from the store to the React application
- Ensure all the actions are passing all the correct data to the reducer
- Ensure the reducer is working as expected

### Unit Tests
- Ensure the test suite is able to run 
- All tests should be passing by the end of your debugging session


## Flow
- Fork and clone this repo
- Make a new branch to work on
- Keep it tidy, think about best practices
- When you are done, make a PR and request review from your instructors.

Have a great day! üòÅ
