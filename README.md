Hi Beth, degbug completed this morning.

**Please make sure that you read the instructions before starting.**
yeah... Maybe, just maybe, that's a good idea XD

## Completed
- Use a proxy server to fetch longitude and latitude to avoid cors error
- Wrap NavBar in withRouter to give it acces to props.history, then implemented back button

- Change first argument of connect from null to mSTP in Search/index.js
- Save user input to state onChange, clear form when it is submitted, prevent page refresh
- Add a root div to index.html in public folder
- Wrap <App /> in <withRouter> and <Provider> tags in index.js in src folder
